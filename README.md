This is the Mentorship application, that will bring mentors and people (students) together to learn more!


Work on creating the alogrithm that connects people in a certain distance or college campus, as well as certain skills match up, certain interests, using the hashtag system to properly group people in a certain location and a certain skill or interest. 

Incorporate a resume building template that everytime you meet with someone it is logged and you can see your progress on a certain project or goal.

You are able to check out your own stats, how many new people you met on a weekly/monthly basis (able to toggle). Certain things that you talked about, you can run the application when you are meeting and it will automatically catergorize words that you say into short note segments.
